The initial stages of the project discussed and analysed stakeholders, target market, opportunities, competition, and usage situations for the app. 
This was followed by a user survey which aimed at determining what features the users wanted in the app and which ones were not preferred. 
The data extracted from this survey was used as a basis for deciding which features to include in the initial app design. 
Using this data as a basis, initial wireframes for the app were designed using pencil and paper. The prototypes for the app design were designed using Adobe XD. 
This was followed by usability testing wherein the users were interviewed by the team members to get their opinions on the features and pages of the app design and the overall user experience. 
The purpose behind the interviews was to find out what users liked, what worked, and what can be added/removed from the design to improve the user experience. Based on results of the usability tests, the app design was modified to improve user experience. 
Using the recommendations from the users, some modifications were made in the final design. If development of the appâ€™s design continued, there would be more stages of usability testing and more revisions to the wireframes. 
At this point, the app is still in the beginning stages of user experience development if it were being developed into a fully functional app.
